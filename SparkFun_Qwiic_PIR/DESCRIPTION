SparkFun Qwiic PIR Sensor
<br><br>
The PL-N823-01 Infrared Sensor is sensitive to the infrared emitted from the human body. This is useful for human presence sensing.
<br><br>
This sensor uses the ADS1015 I2C ADC converter to convert small signals from the sensor to usable data for a microcontroller. An onboard boost converter pumps up the 3.3V, from the Qwiic connector, to 5V to power the sensor and ADC.

This module is equipped with an lens from Kemet Technologies to allow the module to be sensitive up to approximately 5m.
